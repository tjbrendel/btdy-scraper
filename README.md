## Overview

This purpose of this project is to create a front end for admins of the BTDY iRacing league to be able to enter in subsession id's from recent races and have the points automatically calculate for that given race.

### History

This started when the league admins were manually looking at race results on [iracing.com](https://www.iracing.com) and calculating the points in a Google Sheet.
